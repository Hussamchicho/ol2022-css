# Exservise Data Frame

# 1. Create a dataframe "df1" consisting following three variables
# - v1: 1,2,3,4,5,,,,10
# - v2: F,F,F,M,M,M,M,M,M,M
# - v3: 0.0, 0.1, 0.2,....0.9



# 2. create a following vector and combine to "df1".
# - v4: 2.0, 1.8,...0.2
# - hint: by = -0.2




# 3. Create a new variable v5 in df1. 
# v5's values are consisted of sum of v3 and v4.





# 4. Create a following vector and combine to "df1"
# - v6: if v5's value is smaller than 1.5, "B" otherwise "A"
# hint: ifelse()




# 5. Combine v6 to dataframe "df1"


# 6. Calculate sum and mean of variable v3 in df1.
# hint: sum(), mean()



# 7. Print v1's values which the values in v3 is below 0.4 



# 8. Change name of the variables in "df1" in following way: 
# - v1 -> id, v2 -> gender, v3 -> exam1, v4 -> exam2, 
# v5 -> exam_total, v6 -> grade




# 9. Count each values in variable "grade"
# - hint: use table() function
