## Second block

### First Day (June 10)
- Introduction to machine learning : [ol2022css3-ml2.pdf](Slides/ol2022css3-ml2.pdf)
- Python basics : [python_data_type.ipynb](Python_basics_jupyter/python_data_type.ipynb)`

### Second Day (June 11)
- Exercise 1: [exercise1-read-pickle-create-variables.ipynb](ml-text-classification/exercise1-read-pickle-create-variables.ipynb)
- Introduction to text classification : [ol2022css4-text-classification.pdf](Slides/ol2022css4-text-classification.pdf)
- Classifying tweets using Support Vector Machine (SVM) : [svm-detecting-author-twitter.ipynb](ml-text-classification/svm-detecting-author-twitter.ipynb)
  
**Prerequisite**: `NLTK`, `scikit-learn` packages + two NLTK bundles. The section below explains how to install them. Also you need to have data files (`pkl` files) in the working directory. 

    

### How to install packages using conda
1. Open *Anaconda Prompt* (windows) or *Terminal* (mac)
2. Check if you already have the package or not. For this session, we need following two packages: `nltk` and `scikit-learn`. 
   ```
   conda list <package-name>
	```
3. In case you don't have the package,  install them.
   ```
   conda install nltk
   conda install scikit-learn
	```

#### NLTK download
To run the SVM code, you need to download NLTK bundles after you intalled the nltk package. 

```
import nltk
nltk.download()
```
When you execute the code above, there will be a small window allowing you to download NLTK bundles. Among them, download `punkt`, `stopwords`.

## Preparation
### Install R and RStudio
:star: Install both R and RStudio in your laptop before Week 2.

#### R
- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
- Free
- You can download here: [www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org)

#### RStudio
- RStudio provides integrated development environment for R (and other languages).
- Free
- You can download here: [www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com)
